## Code Structure

The application follows a modular and component-based architecture, leveraging React and Next.js. Here's an overview of
the structure:

- `ChatContainer.tsx`: The main component that orchestrates the chat functionality.
- `MessageList.tsx` and `MessageItem.tsx`: Handle the display of chat messages.
- `InputField.tsx`: Manages user input for sending messages.
- `ChatHeader.tsx`: Provides UI controls for theme switching and API key management.
- `ApiKeyDialog.tsx`: Handles API key input and validation.
- `ErrorMessage.tsx`: Displays error messages to the user.

This structure was chosen for several reasons:

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain and test.
2. **Reusability**: Components like `MessageItem` and `InputField` can be easily reused or modified.
3. **State Management**: The use of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) provides efficient state management for this
   application, eliminating the need for additional libraries at this scale. However, as the application grows and the
   complexity of state management increases, I would consider integrating **Zustand** to handle more complex state
   interactions efficiently. Zustand offers a lightweight and scalable approach, allowing for more advanced state
   management patterns without the overhead of larger libraries like Redux.
4. **Performance**: The use of react-window for message virtualization ensures smooth performance even with a large
   number of messages.

## User Interface

The chat interface is designed with user-friendliness in mind:

1. **Intuitive Layout**: The chat follows a familiar layout with messages displayed in a scrollable area and an input
   field at the bottom.
2. **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across
   devices.
3. **Dark Mode**: Users can switch between light and dark modes for comfort in different lighting conditions.
4. **Clear Message Distinction**: User and AI messages are visually distinct, making conversations easy to follow.
5. **Error Handling**: Errors are displayed clearly to the user, with options to dismiss or rectify issues.
6. **API Key Management**: The interface guides users through setting up their API key, with validation to ensure
   correctness.

## Design Choices

### Color Scheme and Typography


- **Light Mode**: Clean whites and light grays for backgrounds, with blue accents for interactive elements.
- **Dark Mode**: Dark blues and slates for backgrounds, with lighter blues for accents.

### Design Approach

The application uses Material-UI (MUI) as its primary design system, supplemented with custom CSS modules. This approach
was chosen for several reasons:

1. **Consistency**: MUI provides a cohesive set of components that work well together.
2. **Customizability**: While using pre-built components, MUI allows for extensive customization to fit specific needs.
3. **Productivity**: MUI's component library accelerates development without sacrificing design quality.
4. **Accessibility**: MUI components are built with accessibility in mind, ensuring the app is usable by a wide range of
   users.
5. **Responsive Design**: MUI's grid system and responsive components make it easier to create layouts that work across
   devices.

Custom CSS modules are used alongside MUI to:

- Provide fine-grained control over specific component styles.
- Keep styles scoped to individual components, preventing conflicts.
- Allow for easy theming and style adjustments without affecting the entire application.

## Testing Approach

To ensure the reliability and functionality of the application, a comprehensive testing strategy should be implemented:

## 1. Unit Tests

### ChatContainer.tsx

1. **Test Initial State**:
    - Verify that the initial state contains a welcome message.
    - Ensure that `isLoading` is initially false.

2. **Test Theme Toggle**:
    - Call `toggleDarkMode` and verify that `darkMode` changes.

3. **Test Input Handling**:
    - Simulate text input and verify that the `input` state is updated.

4. **Test Message Sending**:
    - Mock `continueConversation` to simulate an API response.
    - Call `handleSendMessage` and verify that the message is added to `conversation`.

5. **Test Error Handling**:
    - Simulate an API error and verify that it is properly displayed.

### MessageList.tsx

1. **Test Message Rendering**:
    - Pass a message array and verify that all messages are rendered.

### InputField.tsx

1. **Test Text Input**:
    - Simulate text input and verify that `onInputChange` is called.

2. **Test Send Button Click**:
    - Simulate clicking the send button and verify that `onSendMessage` is triggered.

3. **Test Enter Key Sending**:
    - Simulate pressing Enter and verify that `onSendMessage` is triggered.

### ApiKeyDialog.tsx

1. **Test API Key Validation**:
    - Input valid and invalid API keys and verify the correct response.

2. **Test API Key Saving**:
    - Simulate saving the API key and verify that `onSave` is called.

## 2. Integration Tests

1. **Test Message Sending Flow**:
    - Input a message in the `InputField`.
    - Send the message.
    - Verify that the message appears in the `MessageList`.
    - Verify that a response is received from the assistant.

2. **Test Theme Change**:
    - Toggle the theme in `ChatHeader`.
    - Verify that the theme changes across all components (`MessageList`, `InputField`, etc.).

3. **Test API Key Management**:
    - Open the API key dialog.
    - Input and save an API key.
    - Verify that the `InputField` is unlocked for message input.

## 3. End-to-End Tests (E2E)

1. **Test Full Application Flow**:
    - Load the application.
    - Input an API key.
    - Send several messages.
    - Receive responses.
    - Toggle the theme.
    - Verify that message history displays correctly.

2. **Test Error Handling**:
    - Input an incorrect API key.
    - Attempt to send a message.
    - Verify that the error is displayed.

3. **Test Performance**:
    - Load a large number of messages (100+).
    - Verify the scroll performance and interface responsiveness.

## 4. Accessibility Tests

1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
    - Ensure that all interface elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.

2. **Screen Reader Compatibility**:
    - Verify that all interface elements are correctly announced by screen readers.

3. **Contrast Testing**:
    - Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background in both light and dark themes.

## 5. Performance Tests

1. **Test Application Load Time**:
    - Measure the time to interactivity (Time to Interactive).
    - Ensure that the application loads in under 3 seconds on an average device.

2. **Test Responsiveness with a Large Message Count**:
    - Load 1000+ messages.
    - Verify that scrolling remains smooth (60 FPS).

3. **Test Memory Usage**:
    - Monitor memory consumption during prolonged use.
    - Ensure no memory leaks occur.

## 6. Security Tests

1. **API Key Storage**:
    - Verify that the API key is not accessible through the browser console.

2. **XSS Protection**:
    - Attempt to submit a malicious script in a message.
    - Ensure that the script does not execute when rendered.

3. **HTTPS Enforcement**:
    - Ensure that all API requests are made over secure HTTPS connections.

These tests will ensure the reliability, performance, and security of the chat application. It's recommended to automate
most of these tests for regular execution during development and before each release.
Here's an example of a unit test for the `MessageItem` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react';
import MessageItem from './MessageItem';

test('renders user message correctly', () => {
    const message = {text: 'Hello, AI!', isUser: true};
    render(<MessageItem message={message} darkMode={false} onHeightCalculated={() => {
    }}/>);

    const messageElement = screen.getByText(/Hello, AI!/i);
    expect(messageElement).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(messageElement.closest('div')).toHaveClass('user');
});
```

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Storage**:
    - Risk: Storing the API key in localStorage is not secure.
    - Mitigation: Use secure storage methods like encrypted cookies or a server-side session.
